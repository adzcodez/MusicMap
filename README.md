# MusicMap
Puts the artists you listen to on a map so you can visualise where they are. 

![An example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adzcodez/MusicMap/main/images/demo.gif)

### Features
+ 02/03 Accepts last.fm scrobbles information and plots it on a map using R, Shiny and Leaflet
+ 20/03 accepts Spotify playlist URI to produce a map

### Next Objectives
+ Make it look better
+ Merge Spotify and last.fm pages 
+ Have a splash page where you upload playlist URI or scrobbles.csv
+ Improve handling of URI (currently requires the end of the URI but would be good for it to handle playlist links directly as well)
+ Have loading pages returning the stages in querying
+ Improve map labels with artist information from Spotify API
+ Add Spotify log-in
